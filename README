In order to access the functions in the psd_prop_time_interval.py file in SAGE without 
copying and pasting the entire contents of the raw code into SAGE and evaluating you
can simply evaluate:

load('https://raw.github.com/warnberg/zero_forcing/master/psd_prop_time_interval.py') 

in a SAGE cell and you will have access to the functions described therein.
