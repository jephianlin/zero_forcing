In order to access the functions in the psd_prop_time_interval.py file in SAGE without 
copying and pasting the entire contents of the raw code into SAGE and evaluating you
can simply evaluate:

load('https://raw.github.com/warnberg/zero_forcing/master/psd_prop_time_interval.py') 

in a SAGE cell and you will have access to the functions described therein.



In order to access the functions for directed graphs without 
copying and pasting the entire contents of the raw code into SAGE and evaluating you
can simply evaluate:
files = ('directed_prop_time.py', 'directed_atlas.py', 'directed_min_rank_bounds.py', 'digraphs5_verts.py', 'orientations.py')

for f in files:
  load('https://raw.github.com/warnberg/zero_forcing/master/' + f) 

in a SAGE cell and you will have access to the functions described therein. Note to access 
directed graphs up to 4 vertices use the list directed_atlas, to access the directed 
graphs on 5 vertices use the list di_graphs_5.
